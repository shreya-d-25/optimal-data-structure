# optimal-data-structure
This project is meant to be a supervisor function that suggests an optimal data structure to use on a given query to perform a certain  operation on it.  This is much similar to an if-else statement, but scales up its approach to meet the demands of the queries provided by the user and uses this concept in the most efficient way.
