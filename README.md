# optimal-data-structure
This project is meant to be a supervisor function that suggests an optimal data structure to use on a given query to perform a certain  operation on it.  This is much similar to an if-else statement, but scales up its approach to meet the demands of the queries provided by the user and uses this concept in the most efficient way. 

It can also work as a standalone optimal query run suggestion method which can performed in given time frame and maximize the performance.
This project is meant to act as a standard library of data structures, but the programmer doesn't have to know which structures are available and which ones match to the current task. This is where our project steps in.
